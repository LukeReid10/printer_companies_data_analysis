At the printer repairs company Reid Business Machines (a small family-owned business), I was tasked with analysing the printer market using data from the top 4 supplies in the industry (Brother Ltd, Ricoh Co Ltd, Canon Inc, and HP).
In this project, I utilised Power BI Query Editor to import the 4 sets of data, then coded in DAX to form useful insights in an aesthetic Dashboard.
